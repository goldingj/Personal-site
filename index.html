            <p class = "title">About Me</p>
        <p class = "paragraph">My name is Jessica Golding and I’m a front-end web developer located in Lancaster, PA. I have a passion for learning and creating. I have been working with front-end development for the past 3 years and continue to grow my knowledge of what I already know and discover more to learn everyday. I’m currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and building my knowledge of SEO and back-end languages.  My portfolio consists of projects of my own design and some challenges from FrontEndMentor.  Though I have many projects on my GitHub, I have chosen to showcase the projects that I feel the most proud of and that I feel best show the range of skills that I have acquired over the past 3 years of development.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">When I am not working on a project, I play violin with the West Shore Symphony. I have played for many years and it is one of my great loves in life. I also have extensive experience working with healthcare software, and I look forward to finding ways to incorporate my love for music and knowledge of healthcare into my front-end development.  Please check out my work and let me know what we can create together!</p> <br>
